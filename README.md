# Cpp-based-Online-Shopping-Sim
This is a project I made while learning OOPs in C++, it is a Cpp based Online Shopping System leveraging OOP principles (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism). Features a dynamic product catalog with file handling, interactive search/filtering, and a menu-driven shopping cart/order history. Built using vectors for dynamic data management.
